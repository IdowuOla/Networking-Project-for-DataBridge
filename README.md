# 🖧 Introduction to Networking – Project Overview

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a small office network setup with three departments — **Admin**, **Sales**, and **HR** — each on separate subnets and managed via a central **Cisco router**.  
Access Control Lists (ACLs) were implemented to control communication between networks, allowing only authorized departments to access specific services (e.g., HTTP web server).

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco 2911 Router and Switches  
- Windows/Linux PCs  
- HTTP/DHCP/DNS Server  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)

## 🧩 Network Design Summary
| Department | Subnet | Access Level |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Admin | 192.168.10.0/24 | Full access |
| Sales | 192.168.20.0/24 | Limited HTTP access |
| HR | 192.168.30.0/24 | Restricted access |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- ACLs help enforce **network segmentation** and **security policies**.  
- Proper **IP addressing** and **routing** ensure efficient communication.  
- Testing confirmed successful HTTP access for Admin and Sales, and denied access for HR.
